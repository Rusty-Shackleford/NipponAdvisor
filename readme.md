# NipponBuddy

Let's face it: The fun to be found in Kairosoft games is *figuring out how to play it*.  They'll hide a lot of vital information you need to make basic decisions, and then you've either got to discover the rules by trail and error or look up the details in someone's guide. 

NipponBuddy is a small application for Windows that I am writing while playing Cafe Nippon. Basically, part of the fun I'm having while playing this is was writing code to make the game better for myself.


## Installation

No install yet - please check back later!  I expect I will be spending a good amount of time on it the next couple weeks, and it is my intention to wrap this up fairly quickly.  Leaving little projects like this unfinished is bad for my own morale.

Once it is completed, an executible installer will be hosted on this GitHub project.

## Features
It's going to recommend... which ingredients to use... ya this is WAY over-kill.  

## Screenshots?

Here's an early screenshot, most of the controls are working at this point.
